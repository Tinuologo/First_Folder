<h1><center>My HTML Beginnings</center></h1>
	<p>
	It all began by first going to the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools </a>
	website where I would gain the knowledge needed to make this webpage.
    </p>
    
    
    
<h2> The Basics</h2>
	<p>
    As per the norm, the tutorials began with the basic and eventually ended with the advanced. 
    Here are some of the lessons learned from the tutorials in the basic section. Most elements require a &ltstart tag&gt and an &ltend tag&gt. 
    Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and all elemtents can have attributes.
     Some examples of attributes are href for links, img for images, and style for specify the styling of an element, like color, font, size etc.
    </p>
    
       
<h3 style="color:blue;">Formatting</h1> 
    <p>
    Now when formating your webpage, there are many different things you can do to change the style of the paragraphs. 
    You can change the color and alignment of the headings as displayed above. 
    You can choose to <i>italicize</i>, <b>bolden</b>, <em>emphasize</em>, <sup>superscript</sup>, etc. The choice is yours.
    </p>
    
    
    
<h3> Intermediate </h3>
<p>
In the intermediate section i was introduced to tables, lists, links, and images. Here are examples for all four.
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Name</th>
    	<th>Club</th>
    	<th>Country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    	<td>Christiano Ronaldo</td>
		<td>Piemonte Calcio</td>
    	<td>Portugal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    	<td>Lionel Messi</td>
    	<td>FC Barcelona</td>
    	<td>Argentina</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    	<td>Kylian Mbapp√©</td>
    	<td>PSG</td>
    	<td>France</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<ul>
  	<li>Colors</li>
  		<ul>
    		<li>Green is the best</li>
        	<li>Blue is a second close</li>
        	<li>Yellow with a strong finish at third</li>
    	</ul>
  	<li>Dogs
    	<ul>
      		<li><a href="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bernese-Mountain-Dog_1.jpg">Bernese Mountain Dog</a></li>
      		<li><img src="https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/how-long-do-golden-retrievers-live-KH-long.jpg" alt="Golden Retriever" width="128" height="128"></li>
      		<li><a href="https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mini-australian-shepherd-long.jpg">Mini-Australian Shepherd</a></li>
    	</ul>
  	</li>
	<li>Numbers</li>
  		<ul>
    		<li>1 is first</li>
        	<li>2 comes second</li>
        	<li>0 is nothing but a myth</li>
    	</ul>
</ul>

</p>

<h3> Advanced </h3>
<p>
	In the advanced section of the tutorials, i learned how to work with classes and ids'. 
	Classes are used to define equal styles for elements with the same class name and ids' attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element.
</p>

<p id="myTeams">A.C. MIlan</p>
<p class="sport"> Milan is a football club.</p>

<p id="myTeams">Los Angeles Lakers</p>
<p class="sport"> Lakers are a basketball organization.</p>

<p id="myTeams">Green Bay Packers</p>
<p class="sport"> Packers are an American football team.</p>

<h3> Finale </h3>
<p>
	There we have it. The tutorials have taken me from a beginner to slightly higher than a beginner. I can only get better, at least I hope so.
